## Chapter 1 : Arjun Viṣhād Yog

Chapter 1, Verse 45-46
----------------------
### अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम् |यद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हन्तुं स्वजनमुद्यता: || 45||यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणय: |धार्तराष्ट्रा रणे हन्युस्तन्मे क्षेमतरं भवेत् || 46||

> aho bata mahat pāpaṁ kartuṁ vyavasitā vayamyad rājya-sukha-lobhena hantuṁ sva-janam udyatāḥyadi mām apratīkāram aśhastraṁ śhastra-pāṇayaḥdhārtarāṣhṭrā raṇe hanyus tan me kṣhemataraṁ bhavet
> ---
> - aho — alas
> - bata — horrible results
> - mahat — great
> - pāpam — sins
> - kartum — to perform
> - vyavasitāḥ — have decided
> - vayam — we
> - yat — because
> - rājya-sukha-lobhena — driven by the desire for kingly pleasure
> - hantum — to kill
> - sva-janam — kinsmen
> - udyatāḥ — intending
> - yadi — if
> - mām — me
> - apratīkāram — unresisting
> - aśhastram — unarmed
> - śhastra-pāṇayaḥ — those with weapons in hand
> - dhārtarāṣhṭrāḥ — the sons of Dhritarashtra
> - raṇe — on the battlefield
> - hanyuḥ — shall kill
> - tat — that
> - me — to me
> - kṣhema-taram — better
> - bhavet — would be

### Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. It will be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.

Arjun was surprised; despite being aware that this war would only bring misfortune to all, those who were in the battlefield and the families they would leave behind; they were all hankering to commit this sin. He started with the word “aho,” which means ‘alas’. He had enumerated all the possible catastrophes that were imminent if this war took place, but he was ignoring the very fact that if the wrongdoers were not punished, it would cause greater damage to the society.Often, we keep blaming the circumstances or others but turn a blind eye towards our own weaknesses. Arjun’s justification for not killing his greedy cousins and relatives was driven by his own attachment and compassion towards them. Even though he felt it was a sin to kill them, as they were his relatives, he did not realize that his sentiments were actually materialistic and not transcendental. Blinded by compassion, he had forgotten his dharma as a warrior; that he was beyond this material body. His delusion had come to a point where he was willing to drop his weapons and allow his enemy to kill him unarmed.

Chapter 1, Verse 47
-------------------
### सञ्जय उवाच |एवमुक्त्वार्जुन: सङ्ख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् |विसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानस: || 47||

> sañjaya uvāchaevam uktvārjunaḥ saṅkhye rathopastha upāviśhatvisṛijya sa-śharaṁ chāpaṁ śhoka-saṁvigna-mānasaḥ
> ---
> - sañjayaḥ uvācha — Sanjay said
> - evam uktvā — speaking thus
> - arjunaḥ — Arjun
> - saṅkhye — in the battlefield
> - ratha upasthe — on the chariot
> - upāviśhat — sat
> - visṛijya — casting aside
> - sa-śharam — along with arrows
> - chāpam — the bow
> - śhoka — with grief
> - saṁvigna — distressed
> - mānasaḥ — mind

### Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief.

Arjun’s reluctance to fight the war had now reached its climax. He had now surrendered to his grief and slumped into deep dejection. His condition was the creation of his own material attachments and caused his dereliction of duty. This was a completely unexpected behavior from someone who was considered the epitome of devotion and self-surrender to God. In fact, before the battle, when both parties were mobilizing their armies; given a choice between the entire armed Yadu army and the unarmed Lord Shree Krishna; Arjun chose the Lord, as he had complete faith in him.At this point let us consider who Arjun really was. He was definitely not a novice, bereft of spiritual knowledge. His celestial father was Indra, the king of heaven. Arjun had been to his abode and received several boons from him and other celestial beings. In his past life, Arjun was Nar, part of the twin descensions the Nar-Narayan; where Nar was the perfected soul situated in transcendental knowledge and Narayan the Supreme Lord. Then why in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, a grand warrior of such stature was dropping his weapons? What was the cause of his misery? For the benefit of future generations, Shree Krishna wanted to bring forth the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita. By intentionally confusing Arjun, the Lord had created this opportunity. In this chapter, Arjun put forth to the Lord several arguments and justifications why he should not fight this war, and in the subsequent chapters Shree Krishna has elaborated upon why Arjun’s arguments were inappropriate, and the way forward.

## Chapter 2 : Sānkhya Yog

Chapter 2, Verse 1
------------------
### सञ्जय उवाच |तं तथा कृपयाविष्टमश्रुपूर्णाकुलेक्षणम् |विषीदन्तमिदं वाक्यमुवाच मधुसूदन: || 1||

> sañjaya uvāchataṁ tathā kṛipayāviṣhṭamaśhru pūrṇākulekṣhaṇamviṣhīdantamidaṁ vākyam uvācha madhusūdanaḥ
> ---
> - sañjayaḥ uvācha — Sanjay said
> - tam — to him (Arjun)
> - tathā — thus
> - kṛipayā — with pity
> - āviṣhṭam — overwhelmed
> - aśhru-pūrṇa — full of tears
> - ākula — distressed
> - īkṣhaṇam — eyes
> - viṣhīdantam — grief-stricken
> - idam — these
> - vākyam — words
> - uvācha — said
> - madhusūdanaḥ — Shree Krishn, slayer of the Madhu demon

### Sanjay said: Seeing Arjun overwhelmed with pity, his mind grief-stricken, and his eyes full of tears, Shree Krishna spoke the following words.

To describe Arjun’s feelings, Sanjay uses the word kṛipayā, meaning pity or compassion.  This compassion is of two kinds.  One is the divine compassion that God and the saints feel toward the souls in the material realm, on seeing their suffering in separation to God.  The other is the material compassion that we feel upon seeing the bodily distress of others.  Material compassion is a noble sentiment that is not perfectly directed.  It is like being obsessed with the health of the car while the driver sitting within is famished for food.  Arjun is experiencing this second kind of sentiment.  He is overwhelmed with material pity toward his enemies gathered for battle.  The fact that Arjun is overcome by grief and despair shows that he is himself in dire need of compassion.  Therefore, the idea of his being merciful upon others is meaningless.In this verse, Shree Krishna is addressed as “Madhusudan.”  He had slayed the demon Madhu, and hence gotten the name Madhusudan, or “slayer of the Madhu demon.”  Here, He is about to slay the demon of doubt that has arisen in Arjun’s mind and is preventing him from discharging his duty.

Chapter 2, Verse 2
------------------
### श्रीभगवानुवाच |कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् |अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन || 2||

> śhrī bhagavān uvāchakutastvā kaśhmalamidaṁ viṣhame samupasthitamanārya-juṣhṭamaswargyam akīrti-karam arjuna
> ---
> - śhrī-bhagavān uvācha — the Supreme Lord said
> - kutaḥ — wherefrom
> - tvā — to you
> - kaśhmalam — delusion
> - idam — this
> - viṣhame — in this hour of peril
> - samupasthitam — overcome
> - anārya — crude person
> - juṣhṭam — practiced
> - aswargyam — which does not lead to the higher abodes
> - akīrti-karam — leading to disgrace
> - arjuna — Arjun

### The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjun, how has this delusion overcome you in this hour of peril?  It is not befitting an honorable person.  It leads not to the higher abodes, but to disgrace.

The word Ārya in our sacred books does not refer to any race or ethnic group.  The Manu Smṛiti defines an Aryan as a highly evolved and cultured person.  “Aryan” connotes goodness, like the term “perfect gentleman.”  The aim of the Vedic scriptures is to induce humans to become Aryans in all respects.  Shree Krishna finds Arjun’s present condition in conflict with that ideal, and so reprimands him by calling attention to his confusion in how to live up to this ideal state of being under the current circumstances.The Bhagavad Gita, or “Song of God,” effectively begins from here because Shree Krishna, who was quiet until now, starts speaking in this verse.  The Supreme Lord first begins by inducing in Arjun a hunger for knowledge.  He does this by pointing out that his state of confusion is dishonorable and inappropriate for virtuous persons.  He then goes on to remind Arjun of the consequences of delusion, which are pain, infamy, failure in life, and degradation of the soul.Rather than comforting him, Shree Krishna is making Arjun uncomfortable about his current state.  We all feel uncomfortable when we are confused because it is not the natural condition of the soul.  That feeling of discontentment, if properly channeled, can become a powerful impetus to search for true knowledge.  The suitable resolution of doubt helps a person acquire a deeper understanding than before.  Thus, God sometimes deliberately puts a person in turmoil, so that he or she may be forced to search for knowledge to remove the confusion.  And when the doubt is finally resolved, that person reaches a higher level of understanding.
